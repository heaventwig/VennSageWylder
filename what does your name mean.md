## What's in a name?
My name is Venn Sage Wylder. Some people call me Diagrams. Let's break that down.
- Venn means friend (in Norwegian and Swedish), and I'm a Quaker with viking roots, so that's cool. I'm also a mathematician, and particularly keen on set theory, so I like Venn diagrams. (So does Vice President Kamala Harris!)
- Sage is my middle name. I love it for meaning _wise_. I love it too for coming to me from my mother's mother, for honoring the women's wisdom of my elders and ancestors.
- I'm happy to go by Venn, or Sage, or Venn Sage, or Mx Wylder, or Friend. Or even Diagrams. If you want to be extra respectful and address me very formally, calling on my role as a Quaker (all of us are ministers; we have no leity), you might say "Friend Wylder."
- I say "my name is Venn (like the diagrams)" often enough that some of my friends started calling me diagrams. That's fine too.
