## Venn "Diagrams" Wylder[^2] (Progressive Democrat)
[^2]: My name is Venn Sage Wylder. Some people call me Diagrams. [Let's break that down.](name.md)

Nominated for Justice of the Peace in South Burlington by local Progressives and Democrats.
### Candidate Statement
Growing up on a farm in the Green Mountains, I learned we only all get through hard times — be it mud season or, more recently, flood season — when we help each other. That’s what being a neighbor is about. But we’re likely to know a lot about each other’s business, so it’s best to mind our own and let each other be. That’s what our state motto—Freedom & Unity—is about. Help as best we can, and stay out of each other’s private affairs.

I thrive on diversity and connection, and have always enjoyed learning from the experiences of people with different backgrounds. Highschool roommates from inner city NY, pre-reunification Hong Kong, and the Czech Republic; co-parents with doctorates in neuroscience; mentors in business, relationships, and spirituality with advanced degrees ranging from cybernetics to law to dance and psychology. I find joy in exploring new ideas & approaches, and I’m eager to learn. My intellectual curiosity drives me to see unconventional solutions, to blend rational thought with intuitive insights. I’m here to engage, collaborate, & contribute, eager to share & grow together.

One of the most consistent ways I show up is by making new connections, upsetting our too-precious applecarts, surprising myself and others in ways that make life better for us all.

#### What else do you need to know about me? What might you want to know about me?

- The work I do to build healthy connected communities isn’t just for others, it’s for me, because I need that too. It’s the only kind of place I’ve ever thrived.

#### I believe:
- Local community organizing is one of the clearest paths to a thriving future.
- Thinking is nearly always improved by feeling.
